# ## Problem Statement

# Ask the user for two numbers, one at a time, and then print the result of dividing the first number by the second and also the remainder of the division. 

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# Please enter an integer to be divided: 5

# Please enter an integer to divide by: 3

# The result of this division is 1 with a remainder of 2



## Solution

# ```bash
def main():
    # Get the numbers we want to divide
    dividend: int = int(input("Please enter an integer to be divided: "))
    divisor: int = int(input("Please enter an integer to divide by: "))

    quotient: int = dividend // divisor  # Divide with no remainder/decimals (integer division)
    remainder: int = dividend % divisor  # Get the remainder of the division (modulo)
    
    print("The result of this division is " + str(quotient) + " with a remainder of " + str(remainder))


# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
